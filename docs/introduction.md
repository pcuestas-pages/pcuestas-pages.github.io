Hi! My name is Pablo Cuesta Sierra.

I'm a 22-year-old student from Madrid, Spain, and I'm coming to Switzerland in September to begin my master's degree in Mathematics at ETH.

#### A bit about me

- I have just finished a double bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at the Autonomous University of Madrid. I'm starting my master's with the hope of later pursuing a PhD in Mathematics at ETH.

- I speak Spanish and English fluently and I got a B2 in German in 2019. Although my German is currently a bit rusty, I hope to improve it during the master's.

- I am a tidy, non-smoking person who likes to keep my living space clean and organized, so I take my time to do chores (of course, without being obsessive about it).

- I understand the importance of giving space to my flatmates and respecting their privacy, so I ensure a balanced and harmonious living environment.

- I love cooking and enjoy trying out new recipes.

- I enjoy practicing almost any kind of sport, from basketball and water polo to cycling and hiking. Staying active is important to me, and I'm always up for joining any group activities or exploring new sports.

- I also like traveling. Last week, I was in Seville as a volunteer for the European Congress of Mathematics. This summer I also plan to do the _Camino de Santiago_ and visit Marrakech and London.
